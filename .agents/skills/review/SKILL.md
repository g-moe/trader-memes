# Review

## Overview

Multi-agent review. Spawns parallel read-only subagents with non-overlapping lenses, then synthesizes at each level. Use when a one-pass read would miss blind spots, or when a change warrants deeper scrutiny than a single agent can give.

## Core rules

- Read-only by default. Do not edit code during a review. Fixes are a separate, later turn after user approves.
- Scope, size, and rubric **before** lenses. Capture target / goal / constraints / delivery / `tiny / medium / large` class, then derive an 8–16 item yes/no rubric for THIS target (generic lenses without a concrete rubric produce formulaic, low-signal findings). See [references/grounding.md § Target rubric derivation](./references/grounding.md).
- Default shape: **4 parents × 4 children** for medium targets; right-size down for tiny, up for large (canonical table in [references/lenses.md](./references/lenses.md)). Pick parent lenses from the menu; swap when review type demands it.
- Give each of the four parents a **substantively different framing** — distinct target-surface partition plus distinct failure-class focus — not a lens-label rename. Within each parent, pre-plan **4 orthogonal child angles** covering the target with minimal overlap.
- Each child MUST run a **draft-then-ground** two-pass: draft hypotheses, then ground each with callers / tests / related skills / prior art. Ungrounded hypotheses drop; partially grounded ones downgrade. Quick-pass conditions are in [references/grounding.md](./references/grounding.md).
- Each parent MUST run a **self-verification pass** on every CRITICAL / HIGH finding: "what would make this finding wrong?" Flips → drop. Weakens → downgrade. Record the verification trace in a required `Verified:` field.
- Subagent shape: parents `subagent_type: generalPurpose`, `readonly: true`; children `subagent_type: explore`, `readonly: true`. Spawn parents in parallel (one message, multiple Task calls); each parent spawns its children in parallel. When nested spawn is blocked, fall back to a single-agent pass and mark the lens `degraded`.
- Failure handling: when a child, parent, or spawn fails / times out / returns empty, ship the remaining artifact with the gap in `Key disagreements or uncertainty` and rubric items marked `not-checked (parent/child failed)`. Never silently omit.
- Every finding cites `file:line`, carries severity (`CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/INFO`) and confidence (`high/medium/low`), and references the rubric item it fails. At every synthesis stage, merge → dedupe → resolve contradictions → prioritize. Never concatenate.
- Ground in [root AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md). Prefer standards from repo skills first (see sibling skills in `.agents/skills` directory, repo patterns second, and external docs only when the standard is still unclear.

## Process

### Step 1: Scope the review (Main)

Capture before spawning:

- **target**: PR link, diff, file set, feature name, design doc, schema, migration, architecture slice
- **goal**: what matters most — correctness, safety, design fit, performance, all?
- **constraints**: depth budget, required or skipped lenses, repo area boundary
- **delivery**: single report, inline comments, GitHub PR review, etc.
- **size**: `tiny` (<50 LoC or a single function/component) / `medium` (one route, module, schema slice) / `large` (cross-package refactor, multi-feature PR, whole-subsystem review)

If any field is missing and matters, ask once.

### Step 2: Derive target rubric (Main)

Name what "good" looks like for THIS artifact, not "good code in general". Follow the numbered recipe in [references/grounding.md § Target rubric derivation](./references/grounding.md).

Produce 8–16 short, verifiable yes/no items. When the target exposes fewer than eight distinct surfaces, widen scope to callers/tests or collapse to 4–7 items and record why (do not pad).

Partition `R1…Rn` across the four parents. Within each parent, assign 2–3 items per child. Rubric-item overlap _across parents_ is expected (e.g. R11 may be touched by risk and practicality); overlap _between children of the same parent_ is a planning defect. Findings cite the rubric item they fail.

### Step 3: Pick parent lenses (Main)

Default set (good for almost any PR):

1. **Correctness & Rigor** — logic, invariants, schema parity, edge cases, type truth.
2. **Risk & Failure Modes** — security, data integrity, concurrency, error paths, migration safety.
3. **Practicality & Execution** — readability, testability, observability, complexity, naming, typos, doc drift.
4. **Strategy & Prioritization** — architectural fit, repo conventions, API design, consumer impact, scope creep.

Swap lenses when review type changes. See the full menu — security, performance, architecture, migration, test-suite, UI-only, env/secrets, dependency-upgrade, docs-drift, infra/deploy — in [references/lenses.md](./references/lenses.md).

### Step 4: Plan child angles (Main)

For each parent, pre-assign four **orthogonal** child angles. Angles slice by _failure class_, _data flow_, or _subsystem_ — not by "files 1–5, files 6–10". Overlap between children means the plan failed.

Write down, before spawning:

- target files or diff hunks per child (the `paths` / `diff hunks` that fill the child prompt's `Your assigned scope` block)
- rubric items each child owns
- explicit "do not cover X, Y, Z" exclusions that belong to siblings

Assemble parent and child prompts by filling the templates in [references/prompts.md](./references/prompts.md) with the Step 4 plan.

### Step 5: Spawn the swarm (Main → Parents → Children)

**Main**: spawn all 4 parents in one batched tool call (parallel Task invocations).

**Parent (each)**: spawn its 4 children in parallel.

- Parents: `subagent_type: generalPurpose`, `readonly: true`.
- Children: `subagent_type: explore`, `readonly: true`. Specify `"quick" | "medium" | "very thorough"` thoroughness in the prompt.
- Every child prompt carries the rubric, the assigned angle, rubric items owned, sibling-exclusion boundaries, and the assigned scope slice (paths / hunks).
- Every child runs a **draft-then-ground** two-pass. See [references/grounding.md](./references/grounding.md) and [references/prompts.md](./references/prompts.md).

### Step 6: Parent synthesis with self-verification (Parents)

Each parent, after its children return, produces one parent summary:

- merges findings; keeps strongest evidence on dupes
- flags contradictions with both sides
- ranks by severity × confidence within its lens
- MUST run a **self-verification pass** on every CRITICAL / HIGH finding — "what would make this finding wrong?" — dropping ones that flip, downgrading ones that weaken, and recording the `Verified:` trace on every surviving CRITICAL / HIGH
- if any child failed / timed out / returned empty, records the gap under "Key disagreements or uncertainty" and lists `children_completed: [A,B,D]` so main synthesis can surface it
- returns the shape in [references/report-format.md](./references/report-format.md)

### Step 7: Main synthesis and delivery

Main agent:

- merges 4 parent summaries into one executive review
- rejects any CRITICAL / HIGH lacking a `Verified:` trace (send back for verification; do not promote to Must-fix without it)
- dedupes across lenses (the same issue may surface twice)
- prioritizes must-fix → should-fix → nice-to-fix
- includes grounded typo findings for public names, user-facing copy, docs, config keys, and test names; keep nit-only typo findings as `LOW` or `INFO`
- marks rubric items owned by a failed parent as `not-checked (parent failed)` and surfaces the gap in the executive summary
- separates open questions and explicit uncertainty
- attaches the rubric with pass / fail / not-checked per item
- delivers in the format in [references/report-format.md](./references/report-format.md) (single report by default; translate to the user's requested delivery shape when different)

If user wants fixes applied, do that as a **follow-up turn** after they approve the review.

## Best-practices

### Orthogonal child angles

Key-points:

- Slice by failure class, data flow, or subsystem — not by file ranges.
- Pre-write "do not cover" exclusions for each child.
- Four angles per parent should collectively cover the target with minimal overlap.

Example (Correctness parent over a new Convex API route):

```txt
Child A: request validation — zod schema parity with Convex validator; reject shapes.
Child B: handler control flow — guards, early returns, happy path.
Child C: side effects — DB writes, audit log, scheduled actions, external calls.
Child D: return contract — response type truth, error codes, caller assumptions.
```

Why this is good:

- No child duplicates another's findings.
- Synthesis is short because dedupe work is rare.

### Evidence-bound findings

Key-points:

- Every finding cites `file:line` (or hunk).
- Every finding carries one-line reasoning and confidence (high/medium/low).
- No evidence means drop, or mark "needs follow-up" and downgrade confidence.

```txt
[HIGH][Correctness] packages/convex/convex-backend/src/convex/foo.ts:42
  Reason: handler returns `R.ok(user)` but zod return schema expects `{ user }`.
  Confidence: high.
  Suggested: wrap payload in `{ user }` or relax schema.
```

Why this is good:

- Fix authors jump straight to the spot.
- Forces children to ground claims instead of hand-waving.

### Right-size the swarm

Key-points:

- **Tiny** (single function, <50 LoC, or a small skill/docs file ≤200 lines): 2 parents × 2 children, or a single-agent review.
- **Medium** (one route, one component, one module, one schema slice): default 4 × 4.
- **Large** (cross-package refactor, multi-feature PR, whole-subsystem review — roughly >500 LoC diff or >N files across >M packages): 4 × 4 with broader parent swaths; beyond that, run sequential passes chunked by package (or by critical-dep edge) with an explicit remainder backlog.
- Size class is a Step 1 output, not an after-the-fact observation.
- Full thresholds and per-target-type notes (code, skill, docs, design) live in [references/lenses.md § Right-sizing](./references/lenses.md).

Why this is good:

- Avoids 16 agents for a 30-line change.
- Keeps throughput honest with actual review depth.
- Token budget stays predictable because spawn count is a function of target size, not habit.

### Rubric-guided reviewing

Key-points:

- Name what "good" looks like for THIS target before picking lenses or angles.
- 8–16 short, verifiable rubric items beats a page of abstract principles.
- Each child angle maps to 2–3 rubric items; findings cite the rubric item they fail.

Example rubric snippet (Convex API change):

```txt
R1. Public args schema is zod-derived; Convex validators match.
R3. `prepare` owns auth, permissions, and audit wiring.
R5. Rate-limit strategy matches action cost.
R7. Tests cover happy path, auth denial, and at least one failure branch.
```

Full rubric examples and derivation patterns: [references/grounding.md](./references/grounding.md).

Why this is good:

- Findings become rubric-item anchors plus evidence, not freeform opinion.
- Superficial / generic comments get filtered because they do not map to a rubric item.
- Rubric travels with the review, so the author can check items off after fixing.

### Draft-then-ground children

Key-points:

- Each child runs two passes inside its single turn: **draft hypotheses**, then **ground each hypothesis** with targeted evidence.
- Grounding reads callers, tests, related skills, and prior art; the diff alone is insufficient.
- Hypotheses that flip under grounding get dropped. Partially grounded hypotheses stay but drop to `low` confidence.

Why this is good:

- Directly fights the "shallow, formulaic" failure mode of LLM reviewers.
- Evidence accumulates _before_ commitment, so confidence labels stay honest.
- Catches convention drift that pure diff-reading misses.

## Anti-patterns

Avoid:

- Starting the swarm before scope, size, and rubric are fixed; or spawning children with vague prompts like "review this file".
- Editing code mid-review; review and fix are separate turns.
- Sharding by file ranges rather than by failure class / data flow; or letting two children of the same parent overlap.
- Concatenating child outputs into a parent summary, or skipping the parent self-verification pass on CRITICAL / HIGH findings.
- Findings without `file:line` evidence, severity, confidence, or rubric anchor — or with hallucinated line numbers, invented APIs, paraphrase-treated-as-quote, or `usually`/`typically` claims unrooted in this repo.
- "Consider refactoring" findings with no specific change proposed, and nit-only reports that surface zero substantive findings.
- Four parents running identical prompts with only a lens label swap instead of substantively different framing.
- Ignoring root `AGENTS.md` or skipping an available domain skill that directly covers the review target.
